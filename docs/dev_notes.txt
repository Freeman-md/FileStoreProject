[Phase 1] Core Project Setup + OTP Foundation (Final Working Version)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Created full project directory structure:
    - /src
    - /data
    - /tests
    - /docs
  Added dev_notes.txt for ongoing development tracking.

- Initialised MATLAB workspace:
    - Set project root as working directory.
    - Added /src to MATLAB search path for modular function access.
    - Created main.m as entry point for the future menu-driven application.

- Implemented OTP cryptography module using a MATLAB package:
    src/+otp/
        generateKey.m
        encrypt.m
        decrypt.m
  Converted OTP into a namespaced package (otp.*) for clean, scalable structure.

- Implemented generateKey.m using secure randomness:
    - Constructed RandStream with 'mt19937ar' engine.
    - Used 'Seed', 'shuffle' for non-deterministic key generation.
    - Output: uint8 row vector of random bytes (0–255).

- Implemented encrypt.m and decrypt.m:
    - Both operate on uint8 byte arrays using bitxor().
    - Enforced strict input validation (uint8 types + matching lengths).
    - Normalised inputs to row vectors for consistent XOR behaviour.

- Created Phase 1 test suite under tests/otp/:
    - test_keygen.m: verifies key randomness, length, and uint8 datatype.
    - test_text.m: tests OTP round-trip on simple text strings.
    - test_file.m: tests OTP round-trip on an actual text file in /data.

- Verified OTP correctness:
    - Keys produced with correct length and datatype.
    - Text string → encrypt → decrypt → full match.
    - sample.txt → encrypt → decrypt → recovered identical file.

- Completed cleanup & structure refactor:
    - Moved all OTP logic into src/+otp/ for proper MATLAB namespacing.
    - Updated test scripts to use otp.encrypt, otp.decrypt, otp.generateKey.
    - Ensured consistent function signatures and file naming.

- Phase 1 deliverable completed:
    • Fully working OTP engine (text + files)
    • Secure key generator
    • Namespaced project structure
    • Passing test suite
    • Development environment ready for Phase 2




[Phase 2] OTP Binary + Image File Support (Final Working Version)
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Added reusable binary-safe OTP wrappers:
    - encryptFile.m
    - decryptFile.m
  These read and write raw uint8 bytes using fread/fwrite.

- Normalised all OTP functions to guarantee consistent vector shapes:
    - encrypt.m forces inputs to row vectors: x = x(:)';
    - decrypt.m forces inputs to row vectors: x = x(:)';
  This prevents NxN expansion in XOR and ensures correct output sizes.

- File-level functions load file bytes as column vectors (fread), then
  normalise them with transpose to row vectors before XOR.

- Decryption pipeline outputs a row vector, written directly with fwrite.

- Tests normalise fread output (column) to row using transpose to match
  the original 1×N data for accurate equality checks.

- OTP now supports:
    • text files
    • arbitrary binary files (.bin, .dat, etc.)
    • PNG/JPEG images
    • any raw byte stream

- test_binary.m verified:
    - 1024-byte random binary → encrypt → decrypt → perfectly restored
    - shapes consistent: original (1×1024), decrypted (1×1024)

PHASE 3 — Classic Cryptography Suite

Caesar Cipher
Implemented caesar.encrypt and caesar.decrypt
Clean variable naming, lowercase normalization, wrap-around handling
Preserves non-letter characters
Added full unit test suite covering encryption, decryption, wrap, and non-letter behaviour
All tests passed

OTP
Implemented otp.encrypt and otp.decrypt
Generates random key using randi (1:1 length with input)
XOR-based reversible encryption for text
Added simple round-trip test test_otp.m
Kept strictly within Phase 3 scope (no file/binary features yet)

General
All modules follow MATLAB package structure
All functions deterministic and unit-testable
No out-of-scope features included
